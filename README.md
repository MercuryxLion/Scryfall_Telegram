# scryfall_telegram #

Scryfall Telegram is an inline [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot that uses
[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)'s API to search Magic: The Gathering cards.

All Scryfall syntax that can be understood by the API can be used. A full list
can be found here: [Scryfall Syntax Reference](https://scryfall.com/docs/reference).

Some examples:
- Search a card by name: `@ScryfallBot Bolas`
- Search an instant that can be played in an Esper EDH deck: `@ScryfallBot id<=esper t:instant`
- Search cards that enter the battlefield tapped: `@ScryfallBot o:"~ enters the battlefield tapped"`
